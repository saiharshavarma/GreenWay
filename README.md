<h3>Aim: </h3>
<p>
  Most people rejuvenate in the placidity that nature has to offer. They feel calm and exhilarated by having plants in their houses, around their locality and nature in general. To ease the burden of travelling far and wide for finding the perfect plant for oneâ€™s house, our website incorporates buying and selling options of a vast variety of plants. Not only does it give the user the advantage of purchasing from home but also includes added features like prediction of the survival of plants, newsletter feeds, a platform where our users can solve their queries regarding the environmental conditions required for the growth of the plants, pesticides to protect the plant etc. It contains general information about seed sowing and raising plants. This feature decreases the confusion which one can find by being surrounded by a host of plants of the same species. Our website strives to increase the awareness of the users about the importance of flora by integrating the afforestation drives and the initiatives being taken in this field. People will learn how from environmental impact to personal enjoyment, a world without plants would be catastrophic.
